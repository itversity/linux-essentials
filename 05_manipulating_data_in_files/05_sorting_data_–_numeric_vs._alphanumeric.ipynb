We can use delimiter and field number to sort the data by a particular field \n  * Example 1: Get the order status from orders part-00000 file and sort it\n\n\n    \n    \n    \u00a0cut -d, -f4 orders/part-00000 > order_statuses\n\nGetting 4th field from orders and redirecting to order_statuses\n\nsort order_statuses \u2013 Now we are sorting the data \n\n  * Example 2: Sort the order_cust_ids\n\n\n\nAs we need to sort the file numerically we need to use -n option.\n    \n    \n    sort -n order_cust_ids\n\nPerforming numeric sort\n"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.6.12"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 4}
