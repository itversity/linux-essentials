Let us get started with grep and we will talk about regular expressions at a later point in time.\n\n  * Processes text line by line and prints any lines based on matching with a specified pattern(Patterns in grep are, by default, basic regular expressions)\n  * Used to search text and also used to search the given file for lines containing a match to the given strings or words.\n  * By default, grep displays the matching lines.\n  * Usage of grep: Use grep to search for lines of text that match one or many regular expressions, and outputs only the matching lines. \n\n\n\n#### Syntax of grep:\n    \n    \n    grep [options] pattern [list of files]\n\nThe first argument to grep is a search pattern. The second (optional) argument is the name of a file to be searched.\n\nUsing ls command we can get the list of directories \n    \n    \n    ls -ltdr */\n\ngrep can be used to ways and we are using an example of getting directories to showcase simple usage of grep\n\n  * Pass file as an argument to grep\n  * Pipe output of a command to grep\n\n\n\n#### Passing file as an argument to grep:\n    \n    \n    ls -ltr > ls_output   -   Create file\u00a0\n                                            grep \"^d\" ls_output   -   Check whether the beginning character is d or not -\n\nPassing output of a command to grep:\n    \n    \n    ls -ltr | grep \"^d\"\n                                            \n\n(note:- \u201c^\u201d character means beginning of the line and \u201c| \u201d is used for a pipe which means to redirect or send the output of one program to another program for further processing)\n\n#### Important grep options:\n\nChecking for the whole words in a file.\n    \n    \n    grep -w\n\nDisplay lines that are not matched with the specified search string pattern.\n    \n    \n    grep -v\n\nThis will display everything other than directories.\n    \n    \n    ls -ltr | grep -v \"^d\"\n\nDisplay only the matched string instead of entire line which has matched string.\n    \n    \n    grep -o\n\nSearch for a string in all the files under the current directory and sub-directories.\n    \n    \n    grep -r\n\nFind the number of lines that match the given string/pattern\n    \n    \n    grep -c\n\n#### Examples:\n\nBefore getting into examples and solutions, let us understand how to access the data\n    \n    \n    cd /data/retail_db/orders\n\n\u2013 Go to orders directory\n    \n    \n    head -100 part-00000\n\n\u2013 Use head to preview the data\n    \n    \n    grep -c \"COMPLETE\" part-00000\n\n\u2013 To find the Total count of orders that are COMPLETE\n    \n    \n    grep -c \"PENDING\" part-00000\n\n\u2013 To find out total count for pending orders\n    \n    \n    grep \u201c^[[:digit]]\u201d\n\n\u2013 Check whether in first column all data is numeric or not\n    \n    \n    grep -c \" \"^[[:digit]]\"\\{1,\\},\" part-000000\n\nFor one or more numbers\n\nUsing grep -Ec option \u2013 grep evaluates your PATTERN string as an extended regular expression (ERE) \n    \n    \n    grep -Ec \"^[[:digit]]+ \"\n\nFind out only those first records which have exactly 5 numbers\n    \n    \n    grep -Ec \"^[[:digit]]+ {5}\"\n"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.6.12"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 4}
