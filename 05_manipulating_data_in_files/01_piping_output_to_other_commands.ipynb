Let us see how we can achieve it.\n\nIt is nothing but a form of redirection (transfer of standard output to some other destination) that is used in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems to send the output of one command/program/process to another command/program/process for further processing. \n\nBelow are some of the examples:\n    \n    \n    ls -ltr | rwxrwxrwx\u00a0       - lists files and directories with full access\n                                            cat filename | less        - shows the last lines of text from the file\n                                            cat filename | grep -i a   - searches for the word a in the file\n                                            grep -v part-00000 | head  - searches top lines in a file\n                                            grep -v part-00000 | wc\u00a0-l - counts the files in it which is word count\n"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.6.12"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 4}
