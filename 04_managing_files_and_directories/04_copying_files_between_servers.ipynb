We can copy the files from your machine to remote servers or vice versa using scp. \n\n#### The syntax of scp:\n    \n    \n    scp <local>\u00a0 <username>@<hostname>:/home/<username>\n    \n    \n    scp <username>@<hostname>:/home/<username>/<file_name> <local_directory_or_filename>\n\n  * If we want to recursively copy all the files from the directory from local system to remote or vice versa use the -r option with below command. \n\n\n    \n    \n        scp -r <local>\u00a0 <username>@<hostname>:/home/<username>\n                                            EX: scp -r filename rob@gw03.itversity.com\n\nHere, rob is the username,gw03 is hostname and itversity.com is a domain name\n\n  * If we try to copy the directory without -r option, we get a message saying that it is a directory not a file.\n\n\n\n#### Using rsync\n\nrsync is powerful, fast and is better than scp when copying files. rsync tries to sync the directories between two locations. \n    \n    \n          rsync\u00a0 <source> \u00a0<target>\n                                            EX:   rsync -avzh data mesos@mesos005:\n\n  * Suppose we are trying to copy some files from source to target and then it will check whether the files already exist in the target and it will check the properties of file such as timestamp and size and if there are no differences between the files it does not copy.\n\n\n\nTo know the size of the file.\n    \n    \n    du -sh filename\n"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.6.12"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 4}
