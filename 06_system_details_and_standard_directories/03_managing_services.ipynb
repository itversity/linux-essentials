We use systemctl command for the same.\n\nSystemctl is a dba tool and developers will not have access to it. Earlier we used to run command <service sshd restart> to restart the service and to get the status we use <service sshd status>. With Centos or Redhat 7 versions, they have introduced a command called <systemctl>. System control is the command, using which we can control the system going forward and we can get the status using <systemctl status sshd>. If you want to stop the service you can use <systemctl stop servicename> and start we can use <systemctl restart servicename> to restart the service we use <systemctl restart servicename>\n"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.6.12"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 4}
